# Assignment-1-Winter-2021-CSS342-Library-ADT

Assignment 1 for CSS 342 Autumn Quarter 2021 UWB

This assignment 1 simulates an ADT class for a library to perform common operation such as adding book, removing book, updating storage by using counter. The functions include copy constructor, destructor, addBook, removeBook, listAllBooks and finally a operator<< method to print out all the book in the library in a list form. This is a simple .cpp class that illustrates the basic elements of each ADT file such as constructor, operator methods, destructor, etc.
